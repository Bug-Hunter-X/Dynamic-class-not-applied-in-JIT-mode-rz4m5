This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with dynamically generated content.  The issue is that Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) mode might not pick up classes that are added after the initial page load. This usually happens when you add or remove elements using JavaScript, Vue, React, or similar frameworks.  The dynamic classes are not recognized, resulting in no styling being applied.

Example (Vue):
```vue
<template>
  <div :class="['bg-blue-500', dynamicClass]" >Dynamic Content</div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
data() {
    return {
      dynamicClass: 'text-white'
    };
  },
};
</script>
```
